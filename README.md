Study Tracker


Study Tracker is a Java-based command-line application that helps users record, track, and analyze their daily study activities. The project demonstrates the use of Java Collections Framework, File I/O, and data summarization techniques, making it a practical and educational tool for students and learners.

The application allows users to log study sessions with key details such as date, subject, duration, and a short description. All records are stored in an in-memory list during execution and can be summarized or exported for later review.
